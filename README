What is NorNet?

NorNet is a research testbed for multi-homed systems. Its aim is to provide a research possibility on systems that are connected to multiple ISPs simultaneously, both with IPv4 and IPv6. Researchers therefore get the possibility to run their experiments on nodes distributed over a large geographical area, with real-world Internet connections. There are two parts of the testbed: NorNet Core is the wired part, using a virtualisation software similar to PlanetLab/OneLab. That is, researchers get their own, Linux-based virtual machines on the research nodes, having their own IP addresses in the provider networks. NorNet Edge is the wireless part. Here, researchers get exclusive access to embedded Linux-based systems that are distributed all over the country of Norway, with up to five different mobile broadband connections.
